# now mysql has been installed and the default user root doesnt have a password
# we have to give password to root and then login back

sudo mysql

# the user root has plugin " auth_socket " and can only connect fomr localhost

exit

mysql -u root -p
# use the password from the step above

# sudo mysql_secure_installation # in some tutorial you will find this but i didnt manage to make it working

# now we create the user, password and we modify to login with password and to connect from anywhere
CREATE USER 'director'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'S3curePassword!';

# ----------------------------

# to make mysql working on remote you have to install pymysql and
# edit __init__.py in the folder that contains settings.py
source /home/ubuntu/AssessmentOI/v_assessment/bin/activate
pip install pymysql
# Then, edit the init.py file in your project origin dir(the same as settings.py)
#
# add:
# import pymysql
# pymysql.install_as_MySQLdb()
