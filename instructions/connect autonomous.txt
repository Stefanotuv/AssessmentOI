python -m pip install oracledb --upgrade

sudo pip install libaio

the various file can be downloaded from here

how to modify the settings for the conection

and export the LIB_PATH

------------------- LOCALLY -------------------

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/stefano/Dropbox/NewDev/AssessmentOI/wallet:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export ORACLE_HOME=/Users/stefano/Dropbox/NewDev/AssessmentOI/wallet
export TNS_ADMIN=$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin
export NLS_LANG=English_America.UTF8
export PATH=$PATH:$ORACLE_HOME

------------------- REMOTE -------------------

# transfer the modified files with the connectivity for ADB. the credentials in my case are saved on .env file
scp -i /Users/stefano/.ssh/id_oci_test -r /Users/stefano/Dropbox/NewDev/AssessmentOI/AssessmentOI/.env ubuntu@141.147.107.248:/home/ubuntu/AssessmentOI/AssessmentOI/.env

# in case you modified any python files you may want to refresh the application file
# the assumption is that we are using the same app we have already installed on the VM
git pull https://github.com/Stefanotuv/AssessmentOI.git

# unzip wallet and client, put the file on the folder (under newtork/wallet and network/admin)
# transfer all files for instant client and wallet to the remote machine
# you can also downlaod with curl and then unzip (after downloading the unzip package)
# however this way is much easier as you may haev already downloaded the files locally
scp -i /Users/stefano/.ssh/id_oci_test -r /Users/stefano/Dropbox/NewDev/AssessmentOI/wallet_prod ubuntu@141.147.107.248:/home/ubuntu/AssessmentOI
# dont put the last folder in the destionation path

# to redo the transfer first delete the folder (and the file inside)
rm -rf /home/ubuntu/AssessmentOI/wallet_prod

# on ubuntu, the like with the wallet seems not to work. to make it working a solution would be to add to the
# configuration file of the library the location of the files downloaded including the wallet etc
# the standard procedure is to add to the file with an echo command, alternately edit the file with sudo nano
# $ sudo sh -c "echo /opt/oracle/instantclient_21_1 > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/oracle-instantclient.conf"
# modified manually and for the right conf file
sudo nano /etc/ld.so.conf.d/aarch64-linux-gnu.conf

# change /aarch64-linux-gnu.conf dipending on the VM
# add the location of the wallet
# /home/ubuntu/AssessmentOI/wallet_prod

$ sudo ldconfig
